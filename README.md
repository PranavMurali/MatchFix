# MatchFix
### A Sports Utility Management application build using ReactJS and hosted on Firebase.
#### The website is meant to streamline the process of obtaining sports equipment for playing and also allows students to match with other groups to form large enough groups to play together. It also simplifies the management of resources and facilities for the physical education faculty as they now have a global record of the students using equipment, without the traditional pen and paper method. Built to alleviate the issues of overcrowding at sports facilities in universities and other institutions.
